# Tax_Database_Project
#This is a database system using some Python OOP and PostgreSQL. I will admit that it is far from the cleanest or most effective code, but it was my first real attempt at OOP. I learned a lot from this project, and while it isn't the cleanest and it doesn't fully function as truly intended it's still mine.
